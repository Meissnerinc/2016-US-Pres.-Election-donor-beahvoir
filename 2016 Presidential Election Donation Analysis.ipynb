    "# Analysis of the 2016 Campaign Contribution Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "There were two seminal news events in the last stages of the US 2016 Presidential Election: the release of the Access Hollywood tape that showed Donald Trump make inredibly lewd comments about women and the letter that FBI Director James Comey sent to Congress two weeks before the election which explained that the investigation into Hilary Clinton's emails was reopened. The investigation was reopened because of content that was found on Anthony Weiner's laptop during a different investigation. The letter was revoked a week later because the investigation turned up nothing new on Clinton who had been under investigation for the use of a privae e-mail server during her time as Secretary of State. \n",
    "\n",
    "These news events were massively covered by virtually every media outlet. In this analysis of small donation behavior, I am going to explore whether the events changed the behavior of Clinton and Trump supporters in regards to their campaign contributions. The analysis focuses on the ten most important battleground states where the election outcome was the closest: \n",

To be clear: instead of backing away from their candidate after they had proof that he sexually harassed women, they instead supported him even more. Though morally reprehensible, it does show that the Trump campaign managed to accumulate a more passionate base support than the Clinton campaign did, which is one of the main factors that eventually cost her the electoral college win.
